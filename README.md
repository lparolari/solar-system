# Solar System

A very simple and not faithful solar system simulation with four
entities: sun, mercury, venus and earth. The simulation rotates
counter-clockwise the entities by their rotation speed.

This repo contains the exercise and the solution of the solar system
simulation exercise for high school. Contact me if you need more info.

(TODO: link to the exercise)
